# Managed Code - Open Source Community for .NET Developers

Are you a .NET developer who's had enough of the challenges that come with open-source? Abandoned libraries, sudden licensing changes, hidden gems that no one knows about, and pull requests that gather dust for years? We get it, and we're here to help.


## 👥 Welcome to the **Managed Code Community**

A place where .NET developers can come together to build, maintain, and support high-quality open-source projects. Here, your favorite libraries remain free and accessible, your contributions are valued and acted upon, and you can find the help and resources you need to succeed.


## 🎯 Our Mission

At the Managed Code Community, our goal is to create an ecosystem of reliable, well-maintained open-source projects for the .NET community. We believe that by working together, we can ensure that the libraries and tools we depend on remain available, up-to-date, and of the highest quality.


## 🚀 What We Do

✅ **Develop and improve projects we use daily**: We create and enhance open-source projects based on our real-world experience and needs as .NET developers.

✅ **Support existing projects**: We provide resources and assistance to help maintain and improve existing open-source projects that are important to the community.

✅ **Foster new ideas**: We encourage and support .NET developers in launching and growing their own open-source initiatives.

✅ **Promote hidden gems**: We shine a spotlight on high-quality, lesser-known projects that deserve more attention and use.

✅ **Share knowledge and experience**: We provide a platform for .NET developers to share their insights, learn from each other, and grow together as a community.

1. **Openness and Accessibility**: Free and open-source software that everyone can use and contribute to.
2. **Collaborative Maintenance**: We share the responsibility of maintaining and improving our projects.
3. **Mutual Understanding**: We respect the needs and perspectives of all community members.
4. **Growth and Mentorship**: We help each other learn and develop as developers.
